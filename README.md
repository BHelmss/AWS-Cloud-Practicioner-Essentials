# AWS-Cloud-Practicioner-Essentials

## About This Repo
This repository showcases hands-on projects I've created while progressing through the AWS Cloud Practitioner learning path. For each course module, I design and implement a practical project to reinforce and demonstrate my understanding of key cloud concepts. These projects support my goal of earning the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification and building a strong foundation in cloud computing.
